This is the code and the source data that were used in order to establish the analysis of the contents on PharmGKB. The ultimate goal is to quantify the biogegraphical bias in pharmacogenomic studies worldwide.

PharmGKB is a leading resource that aggregates, curates and integrates data on pharmacogenomics. PharmGKB constitutes a catalog of genetic variants affecting drug responses. Using PharmGKB as reference, we were able to relate number of individuals (cases) from different biogeographical regions associated with drug response annotations. The biogeographical groups reported in PharmGKB are based on a standardized system for annotating populations in pharmacogenetic research.
